# Erdos-Problems-
This Repository contains the results of my collaborations with several AI models, in a "serious" attempt to partially or fully solve some open Erdos problems from the original Erdos website: www.erdosproblems.com 

# Mission Statements
- Meaningfully contributing to mathematical open problems that seem interesting to me.
- Proving that a sophisticated use of LLMs can help solving very hard math problems, not only trivial ones. (I believe this hasn't been shown yet).
